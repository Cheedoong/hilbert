<p><br>
</p><p>Hilbert curves are one of a class of space filling curves - continuous,
nonsmooth curves that pass arbitrarily close to every point in space of
arbitrary dimension - and much information about planar Hilbert curves
is on the web - see <a href="http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~eww6n/math/HilbertCurve.html">here</a>
for example - but little information on efficient generation of Hilbert
curves and related activities like Hilbert sorting, Hilbert range queries,
and so on, is available.&nbsp; The common recursive generation of planar
Hilbert curves does not easily lead to fast nonrecursive algorithms for
related problems, nor to higher-dimensional generalizations. A rather opaque
description of a nonrecursive algorithm by Butz ("Alternative Algorithm
for Hilbert's Space-Filling Curve", IEEE Trans. Comp., April, 1971, pp
424-426) led to an implementation by Spencer Thomas that appeared in Graphics
Gems and has been widely circulated on the net.
</p><p>I began with his implementation, and began rearranging it to eliminate
the need for various precomputed tables.&nbsp; In the process, I found
that the basic index-to-point and point-to-index calculations could be
made quite terse, without any supplementary tables.&nbsp; I extended those
algorithms to allow the comparison of two points to see which falls first
on a Hilbert curve.&nbsp; Although this comparison can be achieved by converting
each point to its integer index and comparing integers, there can be a
problem with regard to the size of the resulting integers overflowing conventional
integer types.&nbsp; My implementation of the comparison is less sensitive
to this problem.&nbsp; Further extensions led to algorithms for finding
the first vertex of a box to appear on the Hilbert curve, finding the first
point (not necessarily a vertex) of a box to lie on the curve, and for
finding the first point after a given point to lie in the box.
</p><p>The purpose of this work is to enable efficient multidimensional searches
and to associate spatial locality in searches with spatial locality in
the ordering of items in a B-tree based database.&nbsp; With the ability
to find the first point in a box after a given point, it is possible to
enumerate all the points in the database within a box without examining
every point in the database.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, it would be possible
to compute efficiently "spatial joins" - that is, all pairs of points that
both lie in some small box.
</p><p>At this point, I can explain the algorithms best by offering the source
code, so here is the C <a href="http://www.tiac.net/~sw/2008/10/Hilbert/moore/hilbert.c">source</a>
and here is the corresponding <a href="http://www.tiac.net/~sw/2008/10/Hilbert/moore/hilbert.h">header</a>
file.
</p><p>Please let me know if you find this implemenation of nonrecursive multidimensional
Hilbert curve methods useful or entertaining.
